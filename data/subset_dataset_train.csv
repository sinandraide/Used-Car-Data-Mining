With no commissioned sales staff, we offer a refreshing ""NO PRESSURE"" and ""NO HAGGLE"" buying environment. Keeping our overhead to a minimum allows us to sell at at much lower margins than other dealerships.  DO VEHICLES COME WITH ANY WARRANTY? All of our vehicles are sold AS-IS. The reason for this is because we choose to give our customers maximum savings on the initial vehicle purchase. In other words, unlike your typical car dealership, we do not mark up our vehicle price to cover the cost of including a warranty. We find that most buyers would rather have the savings upfront. **A WARRANTY IS AVAILABLE AT AN ADDITIONAL COST; PLEASE ASK FOR DETAILS**  DO WE OFFER FINANCING? We have several local lenders in place to assist with vehicle financing. If you are in need of financing, call GREG at 225-647-5501 to discuss options.  WHAT PAYMENT METHODS DO WE ACCEPT? Cash, Visa, Mastercard, and Discover Card are accepted. (2.5% Fee for Using Credit / Debit Card) We DO NOT accept ANY type of Check...sorry.  HOURS OF OPERATION?

If youre seeing this ad, it is likely that the vehicle IS for sale within the Autonation network. Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved. Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time.	This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don't still have this vehicle, do you?	If the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you.	You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot?	No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.	Can I really secure financing with zero down payment?	Many customers actually take delivery without a checkbook or credit card.	While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership.	Do you take trade-ins?	Yes.	We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either. We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases.	What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth.	This is another very common situation that usually won't prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle.	Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate?	We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help.	We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.	So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do?	COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page. Just ask ""Where might I see this vehicle?"". Someone will respond promptly.	I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there?	Yes. We have very simple process for this very common situation. Just give us a call.	About UsWe make buying and selling a pre-owned vehicle easy. Our 1Price-Pre-Owned Vehicles come with a 5-day return policy, Sirius XM  and more. Shop certified pre-owned vehicles online or in-store. Plus, wellbuy your car, no purchase necessary.

Not my fault, however, blame Toyota for making a V6 motor that only made 150hp out of the factory the same years they were making Supras and Celicas. - Radio is all wacked out, Aux to cassette adapter is stuck in tape player, and it has no antenna. - Tons of dents/paint fading all around it, however, none of them resulted in any suspension issues - No rear bumper - Odometer came disconnected during a previous ownership, was able to get it plugged back in, however I still have no clue how far it had been driven before I fixed the issue(reason for odometer broken) - Single interior light does not function, is the least important one anyway -Speedometer cable has been snapped  I am selling this vehicle mainly because I just plain don't want it anymore, and I need something more efficient in general. The engine runs good, recently did a engine treatment that worked better than I thought it would. The transmission works and most likely will for a long time, it just sucks because the automatics in this generation of 4Runners' were all 4-speeds compared to the 5-speed manual. Price is relative to the amount of money put into vehicle. I would recommend this as a weekend off-roader/ project car.",,ca,38.075948,-120.547743,2021-04-22T20:28:40-0700,2100,4runner,toyota,offroad,4wd,6,clean,black,1990-2000,automatic,full-size

We also hand pick our trucks and suvs from a rust free environment. So 1-2 years down the road you're not wishing you'd never seen that rusty truck. Something we strive to avoid. We pay more for the non-rusty vehicles so your not stuck with costly rust repairs. Not only the repairs you can see but the ones you can't. which include things like brakes, exhaust, frame rot, bed support rot and the one thing that cost you more in the long run, the things that nobody really hears about.... its when you take your truck in for a repair of any kind and the mechanic has to spend hours fighting the rusty bolts and brackets that have fused themselves together.

If youre seeing this ad, it is likely that the vehicle IS for sale within the Autonation network. Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved.  Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time.			 						 			 This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don't still have this vehicle, do you?			 						 			If the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you.			 						 			You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot?			 						 			No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.			 						 			Can I really secure financing with zero down payment?			 						 			Many customers actually take delivery 			 			without a checkbook or credit card.			 			 While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership.			 						 			 Do you take trade-ins?			 						 			Yes.			 			 We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either.  We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases.			 						 			What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth.			 						 			This is another very common situation that usually 			 			 won't 			 			prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle.			 						 			 Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate?			 						 			We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help.			 						 			We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.			 						 			So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do?			 						 			COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page.  Just ask ""Where might I see this vehicle?"". Someone will respond promptly.			 						 			 I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there?			 						 			Yes. We have very simple process for this very common situation. Just give us a call.			 						Accessories & color may vary. Dealer not responsible for errors or omissions.

We also hand pick our trucks and suvs from a rust free environment. So 1-2 years down the road you're not wishing you'd never seen that rusty truck. Something we strive to avoid. We pay more for the non-rusty vehicles so your not stuck with costly rust repairs. Not only the repairs you can see but the ones you can't. which include things like brakes, exhaust, frame rot, bed support rot and the one thing that cost you more in the long run, the things that nobody really hears about.... its when you take your truck in for a repair of any kind and the mechanic has to spend hours fighting the rusty bolts and brackets that have fused themselves together. This will definitely cost you money. Why you ask?? Because time and more importantly mechanic frustration cost you money!! Ask us how we can find you the right truck that's going to last.Visit Premier Trucks and Imports online at premiertrucks.net to see more pictures of this vehicle or call us at 366-399-3221 today to schedule your test drive. WE HAVE SEVERAL CREDIT UNIONS THAT WANT YOUR BUSINESS LOW RATES AND GREAT TERMSFEEL FREE TO CALL OR TEXT ANYTIME! WARRANTIES AVAILABLE ON ALMOST ALL VEHICLES WE SELL!!!

Reviews: * Wonderfully supportive seats; ample cargo capacity; plentiful safety features; available integrated rear booster seats. Source: Edmunds * If you’re looking for a vehicle that can tackle the great outdoors or snow-covered roads with ease, but you don’t want a bulky or unsophisticated SUV, the 2011 Volvo XC70 is a great choice. Source: KBB.com   No phone calls please, email or text from serious buyers only.    Redesigned last year, the 2009 Volvo XC70 wagon receives standard Bluetooth connectivity and the new technology package that includes active bi-xenon headlights plus washers, satellite radio, a premium audio system and rear-seat headphone jacks and audio controls. The new T6 adds a watch-dial instrument cluster and aluminum interior trim. The Volvo XC70 3.2 is equipped with a 3.2L inline-6 engine cranking out 235 hp and 236 lb-ft of torque joined to a six-speed automatic with manual shift capability and all-wheel drive. The Volvo XC70 T6 is powered by a new turbocharged 3.0L inline-6 engine that churns out 281 hp and 295 lb-ft of torque with the automatic transmission and AWD system. EPA fuel economy estimates for the 3.2 are 15 mpg city/23 mpg hwy and 18 mpg combined, while the T6 drops that by 1 mpg on the highway. Standard safety equipment includes stability control, hill descent control, antilock disc brakes, front-seat side airbags, full-length side curtain airbags and front head restraints. The collision avoidance package and blind-spot warning system are optional.

If youre seeing this ad, it is likely that the vehicle IS for sale within the Autonation network. Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved.  Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time.			 						 			 This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don't still have this vehicle, do you?			 						 			If the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you.			 						 			You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot?			 						 			No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.			 						 			Can I really secure financing with zero down payment?			 						 			Many customers actually take delivery 			 			without a checkbook or credit card.			 			 While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership.			 						 			 Do you take trade-ins?			 						 			Yes.			 			 We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either.  We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases.			 						 			What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth.			 						 			This is another very common situation that usually 			 			 won't 			 			prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle.			 						 			 Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate?			 						 			We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help.			 						 			We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.			 						 			So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do?			 						 			COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page.  Just ask ""Where might I see this vehicle?"". Someone will respond promptly.			 						 			 I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there?			 						 			Yes. We have very simple process for this very common situation. Just give us a call.			 						Accessories & color may vary. Dealer not responsible for errors or omissions.

I refer to it in the headline as a wheelchair van, because wheelchair van is the term most folks use when searching for a wheelchair-access vehicle. This is because most folks don’t know there is anything that will accommodate a wheelchair, other than a van. This awesome Scion (a division of Toyota) is a rare, customized, sporty example of what is possible, other than a van, in the world of wheelchair access vehicles.   Are you searching for an affordable wheelchair access vehicle in truly fantastic cosmetic and functional condition?  Do you want relatively low miles plus a warranty at no extra cost?  Do you prefer to buy from a faith-based business?  (Note: our vans pass emissions, including CALIFORNIA)  You've discovered one of few sources (possibly the only one) in the entire United States where you can purchase a ""Certified"" (highly rejuvenated cosmetically & functionally) mobility access vehicle at typical prices of $10,000-$20,000. Numerous professional shops substantially rejuvenate each one.  Thousands of dollars (at wholesale cost) and many weeks are invested into each rejuvenation process. Each includes a warranty. Plus, this Scion has now been freshly, notably customized to add to its modern appearance and sporty nature.   This is a 2011 SCION XB and it has only 78,000 miles. Most people who need a wheelchair access vehicle assume that they must choose between a full-size van or a minivan.  And in the process that person and their family believe they must accept that the days of owning a fun, sporty, aesthetically modern, or cool vehicle are gone!  This Scion defies that notion entirely . Plus, it has low miles and is in our usual “Certified’ level of condition, having undergone extensive cosmetic and functional rejuvenation, in order to reach the “Certified” level. This has a normal, functional rear seat and unmodified cargo/hatch area, plus it accommodates most wheelchairs in the front passenger area due to an amazing amount of highly engineered, costly modifications. And when you are at our website, you can read about the brand-new package of custom features which we added during our process with it here.   Please visit our website to see much detail and more photos.  And don’t be concerned, as this is not a haphazard conversion done by a random shop.  Rather, this was converted by a quality, decades-old, large company in the Midwest named, FREEEDOM MOTORS.  They primarily create wheelchair access vans, but they also convert some SUV and crossover vehicles, such as this. Their new wheelchair access vehicles are sold throughout the United states.

It's been a great SUV for us so far, we just don't have a need for a second vehicle right now.   We purchased this RAV4 for the reliability and safety, and it never let us down. It would be an excellent vehicle for a first time driver. This is the AWD version, it handles excellently with any slick rain or snow we've been experiencing here in Austin. Made it through all that snow with zero issue.   Just recently had an oil change (Changed every 5K miles since 95K when we purchased it), front brake pads and wheels rotated.   My wife used this primarily as her vehicle to run food orders with Door Dash and Uber eats, which worked great with the excellent MPG it got.   I'm happy to take more photos upon request. We are still paying towards the loan with RBFCU, so no trades accepted thank you.

If youre seeing this ad, it is likely that the vehicle IS for sale within the Autonation network. Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved.  Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time.			 						 			 This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don't still have this vehicle, do you?			 						 			If the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you.			 						 			You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot?			 						 			No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.			 						 			Can I really secure financing with zero down payment?			 						 			Many customers actually take delivery 			 			without a checkbook or credit card.			 			 While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership.			 						 			 Do you take trade-ins?			 						 			Yes.			 			 We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either.  We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases.			 						 			What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth.			 						 			This is another very common situation that usually 			 			 won't 			 			prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle.			 						 			 Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate?			 						 			We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help.			 						 			We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.			 						 			So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do?			 						 			COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page.  Just ask ""Where might I see this vehicle?"". Someone will respond promptly.			 						 			 I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there?			 						 			Yes. We have very simple process for this very common situation. Just give us a call.			 						Accessories & color may vary. Dealer not responsible for errors or omissions.

If youre seeing this ad, it is likely that the vehicle IS for sale within the Autonation network. Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved.  Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time.			 						 			 This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don't still have this vehicle, do you?			 						 			If the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you.			 						 			You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot?			 						 			No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.			 						 			Can I really secure financing with zero down payment?			 						 			Many customers actually take delivery 			 			without a checkbook or credit card.			 			 While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership.			 						 			 Do you take trade-ins?			 						 			Yes.			 			 We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either.  We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases.			 						 			What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth.			 						 			This is another very common situation that usually 			 			 won't 			 			prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle.			 						 			 Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate?			 						 			We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help.			 						 			We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.			 						 			So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do?			 						 			COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page.  Just ask ""Where might I see this vehicle?"". Someone will respond promptly.			 						 			 I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there?			 						 			Yes. We have very simple process for this very common situation. Just give us a call.			 						Accessories & color may vary. Dealer not responsible for errors or  omissions.

The staff at Rick's Auto Marketing Center South is committed to serving you, our friends and customers and we look forward to earning your business. For this reason, when dealing with Rick's Auto Marketing Center South you can be assured that your experience will be pressure free and that your satisfaction will be guaranteed.  Automotive Experience Richard Yow, of Rick's Auto Marketing Center South, opened his flagship dealership approximately 27 years ago in Carthage, North Carolina. Since this time, Richard has expanded his business nationwide by having a transparent business structure which has effectively built and continues to build customer loyalty. Proof of continued business excellence is evidenced by his flawless record with the Better Business Bureau, his reputation in the industry for ethical leadership and statewide recognition as a small business leader (as seen in North Carolina Small Business of the Year). Following present day operations at the North Carolina dealership, Richard vows to utilize the same practices and procedures at Rick's Auto Marketing Center South.  What Do We Sell? The automobiles being offered for sale at Rick's Auto Marketing Center South are prior corporate fleet lease automobiles and not prior rental or auction units.  How do You Benefit from Purchasing an Automobile from Rick's Auto Marketing Center South? As a consumer, you can be assured that the automobile you are purchasing has been mechanically maintained under a fleet service maintenance program since new. The maintenance program, which is similar to the preventative maintenance guidelines as suggested by the manufacturer, requires that all automobiles be timely inspected and undergo routine oil-changes and tune-ups. Furthermore, most of the off-lease automobiles offered for sale have only been assigned to and driven by one driver / owner before arriving on our lot.  What Sets Us Apart From the Others? From the moment you walk in the door, our friendly and relaxed staff will lead you through the buying process without the high pressure you find at other dealerships. At Rick's Auto Marketing Center South, we believe in clear no haggle pricing and aren't afraid to clearly list the purchase price on each automobile.  We are ready to serve you. Feel free to contact us with any comments or questions you may have.

If youre seeing this ad, it is likely that the vehicle IS for sale within the Autonation network. Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved.  Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time.			 						 			 This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don't still have this vehicle, do you?			 						 			If the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you.			 						 			You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot?			 						 			No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.			 						 			Can I really secure financing with zero down payment?			 						 			Many customers actually take delivery 			 			without a checkbook or credit card.			 			 While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership.			 						 			 Do you take trade-ins?			 						 			Yes.			 			 We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either.  We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases.			 						 			What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth.			 						 			This is another very common situation that usually 			 			 won't 			 			prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle.			 						 			 Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate?			 						 			We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help.			 						 			We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it.

I have owned this truck for eight years. The truck spent most of its life in San Diego, CA. That being said Michigan has taken a toll on the body over the last eight years. Now to get right into it.   Truck 1997 F-250 XLT crew cab 4x4 7.3 turbo diesel. 255000 miles and going up as I drive this daily.  There are only two reasons I am selling my truck. Both are not easy to fix unfortunately. The biggest problem is the rust above the windshield. It has gotten to the point over this past winter that it leaks.   The other issue is the trans has a second gear valve that sticks sometimes and doesn’t like to shift into third unless you really get on it. I have been driving the truck with this issue for the last four years. Crazy I know!   The truck is pretty much all stock as well. There are many things to list on pros and cons here. I am not getting into all of that unless you are interested.   Remember everyone you are looking at a 24 year old truck. I know the truck needs work and I am in no hurry to sell it.   Call or text me anytime with questions or concerns. I’ll be happy to talk things over.   Thanks for looking and I hope someone has a passion for the OBS and is willing to put money into one.

Thank you for your interest in one of AutoNation Ford Katy 's online offerings. Please continue for more information regarding this 2017 Toyota Tacoma SR5 with 58,553mi. Drive home in your new pre-owned vehicle with the knowledge you're fully backed by the CARFAX Buyback Guarantee. Handle any terrain with ease thanks to this grippy 4WD. Whether you're on a slick pavement or exploring the back country, you'll be able to do it with confidence. The incredibly low mileage and painstaking upkeep on this Toyota Tacoma makes it a once-in-a-lifetime deal that won't last long! Call us today to reserve your test drive! The Tacoma competes with other compact pickup trucks such as the Chevrolet Colorado and the Nissan Frontier. However, neither of these competitors has the reputation of Toyota. Unlike full-sized trucks, the Tacoma is small enough to make sense in both urban and suburban environments. The Tacoma can maneuver nimbly in tight parking lots, and its turning radius is kept reasonable. At the same time, the Toyota offers the kind of utility that compact SUVs can only dream of. With a broad range of customization options, the Tacoma offers a surprisingly amount of comfort, and even gives owners the kind of interior space normally found in sedans. The Tacoma is truly a do-everything vehicle. *Money-Back Guarantee is valid for 5 days or 250 miles, whichever comes first. Subject to certain terms and conditions. See store for details.

If youre seeing this ad, it is likely that the vehicle IS for sale within the Autonation network. Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved.  Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time.			 						 			 This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don't still have this vehicle, do you?			 						 			If the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you.			 						 			You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot?			 						 			No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.			 						 			Can I really secure financing with zero down payment?			 						 			Many customers actually take delivery 			 			without a checkbook or credit card.			 			 While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership.			 						 			 Do you take trade-ins?			 						 			Yes.			 			 We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either.  We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases.			 						 			What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth.			 						 			This is another very common situation that usually 			 			 won't 			 			prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle.			 						 			 Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate?			 						 			We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help.			 						 			We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.			 						 			So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do?			 						 			COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page.  Just ask ""Where might I see this vehicle?"". Someone will respond promptly.			 						 			 I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there?			 						 			Yes. We have very simple process for this very common situation. Just give us a call.			 						Accessories & color may vary. Dealer not responsible for errors or omissions.

If youre seeing this ad, it is likely that the vehicle IS for sale within the Autonation network. Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved.  Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time.			 						 			 This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don't still have this vehicle, do you?			 						 			If the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you.			 						 			You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot?			 						 			No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.			 						 			Can I really secure financing with zero down payment?			 						 			Many customers actually take delivery 			 			without a checkbook or credit card.			 			 While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership.			 						 			 Do you take trade-ins?			 						 			Yes.			 			 We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either.  We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases.			 						 			What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth.			 						 			This is another very common situation that usually 			 			 won't 			 			prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle.			 						 			 Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate?			 						 			We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help.			 						 			We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.			 						 			So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do?			 						 			COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page.  Just ask ""Where might I see this vehicle?"". Someone will respond promptly.			 						 			 I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there?			 						 			Yes. We have very simple process for this very common situation. Just give us a call.			 						Accessories & color may vary. Dealer not responsible for errors or omissions.

We put on around 62K highway miles since 2013. And have put tons of money into this car. We have lots of paperwork. This car should be good to go for a while. Although, the siped tires are due to be rotated. The AC doesn't work, but the heater does. It has a belt/pulley squeak/chirp that always comes back. And the Check engine light is on due to a PO420 Code. This means the catalytic converter is not functioning efficiently, therefore increasing the output of harmful pollutants by the vehicle. My mechanic said I should just live with the code. Fixing it is not worth the cost. The power windows and locks all still work. The trunk unlocks with a key but you have to lift the gate. It needs new lift supports (probably), but the gate stays up. The car is far from perfect. However, it is pretty clean and not beat to sh** or totally rusted out. And it is still pretty cute. Look through all the pics. See some of the most recent big-money repairs.

If youre seeing this ad, it is likely that the vehicle IS for sale within the Autonation network. Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved.  Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time.			 						 			 This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don't still have this vehicle, do you?			 						 			If the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you.			 						 			You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot?			 						 			No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.			 						 			Can I really secure financing with zero down payment?			 						 			Many customers actually take delivery 			 			without a checkbook or credit card.			 			 While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership.			 						 			 Do you take trade-ins?			 						 			Yes.			 			 We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either.  We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases.			 						 			What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth.			 						 			This is another very common situation that usually 			 			 won't 			 			prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle.			 						 			 Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate?			 						 			We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help.			 						 			We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.			 						 			So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do?			 						 			COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page.  Just ask ""Where might I see this vehicle?"". Someone will respond promptly.			 						 			 I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there?			 						 			Yes. We have very simple process for this very common situation. Just give us a call.			 						Accessories & color may vary. Dealer not responsible for errors or omissions.

If youre seeing this ad, it is likely that the vehicle IS for sale within the Autonation network. Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved.  Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time.			 						 			 This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don't still have this vehicle, do you?			 						 			If the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you.			 						 			You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot?			 						 			No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.			 						 			Can I really secure financing with zero down payment?			 						 			Many customers actually take delivery 			 			without a checkbook or credit card.			 			 While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership.			 						 			 Do you take trade-ins?			 						 			Yes.			 			 We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either.  We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases.			 						 			What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth.			 						 			This is another very common situation that usually 			 			 won't 			 			prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle.			 						 			 Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate?			 						 			We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help.			 						 			We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.			 						 			So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do?			 						 			COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page.  Just ask ""Where might I see this vehicle?"". Someone will respond promptly.			 						 			 I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there?			 						 			Yes. We have very simple process for this very common situation. Just give us a call.			 						Accessories & color may vary. Dealer not responsible for errors or omissions.

The car was stylized to represent a 740i in Germany not one that was sold in the NA market.  Hence the Euro plate on the front.    Look close - there are not many typical issues with the car.  When issues arose items and parts where repaired or replaced through the life of the car.  You will find this car in very fine condition.  In addition the M62TU has just had engine guides, Vanos replacement, gaskets, filters, fluids many parts and hours of service.  Paperwork for the parts and work is available for your inspection. You will find this car to be ready for the Ultimate Driving Experience.  The Navigation computer is the MK4 DVD and the OS is V32 with the two disk 2015 BMW High software.

A fair bird from the early 70s designed specifically for Campers. We bought her in 2013 when we moved to California as a weekend adventure get away. We have adventured with her all across northern California (Tahoe, Bodega Bay, Yosemite, Big Sur, Napa and more). We have decided to move and unfortunately cannot bring the camper with us. Both the camper and the Ford are stored in Half Moon bay in a storage unit.  **General Information about truck & camper:** TRUCK:  -1973 Ford F350 SuperCamper -Dimensions camper + truck: 25 feet long X 7 feet wide X 10.25 Feet Tall (including 12 inch roof rack) -Incredible sound system with amplifiers behind seats - worth 1.5k alone -CD player with USB plug-in -In the last 2 years, we FIXED the timing belt, radiator, chain kit, distributer, and transmission accumulator - since then we have done routine maintenance (oil changes) every 2,800 miles and fix things if they break now and then. -Truck (F3250 Super Camper) does not currently reliably run, and needs some work to make sure its running consistently. -8-10 MPG -Green and blue exterior / green leather and fabric interior with wood trim (in great condition) -~150,000 miles CAMPER: -Great lighting, tons of windows -In 1973, Ford Motor Company and Starcraft RV partnered to develop and manufacture the American Road, a truck camper decades ahead of its time. -44+ years after the debut, the American Road remains a unique and compelling statement in truck camper history. From its smart floor plan, to the fiberglass shell construction, to the use of basement holding tanks, the American Road design could be considered competitive with the non-slide truck campers in production today. -Not sure if water, heater/air conditioner etc work, we have only used the propane for the fridge and stove/oven which work well -Three burner stove and oven works well -Nordic fridge does not currently work (free large size cooler you can use inside camper if you purchase it) -Comes with brand new 8 inch memory foam full size mattress (we used this new one 1x in 2019) -Very high ceiling - great for tall people -People typically buy these and remodel them (gut everything and start fresh) - to each their own  PRICE:  Willing to sell truck and camper topper separately but you will have to pay for someone to take the camper off the truck. -Camper topper: $2,000 -Truck: $1,000  ***Text me if you are interested in purchasing (six.five.zero.seven.nine.six.six.one.six.zero).

The big-rig character is personified by the massive but well-proportioned styling that includes an imposing chrome grille and football-sized Blue Oval badge. The truck's gentler side offers comfortable seating and interior amenities to soothe the soul on long trips. For the hard worker or commercial owner, there's a long list of available packages, options and features that fit their needs and possibly enhance productivity.

This is the final year for the first generation Raptor with the coveted 6.2 liter V8, the best year for the Raptor. This vehicle has spent its entire life in Central Oregon and has been meticulously maintained servicing the oil every 5k miles with synthetic oil and every major fluid in the vehicle every 30k miles. The modifications done to the rig are minimal, yet tasteful, including a Banks Ram-Air intake, Magnaflow cat-back exhaust, bronze Method Race Wheels and 35 inch Goodyear Duratracs that have 5k miles on them. I did the mid perch on the front struts to level the suspension and also added RCV front hub actuators to make the 4wd system bullet proof.

If youre seeing this ad, it is likely that the vehicle IS for sale within the Autonation network. Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved.  Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time.			 						 			 This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don't still have this vehicle, do you?			 						 			If the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you.			 						 			You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot?			 						 			No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.			 						 			Can I really secure financing with zero down payment?			 						 			Many customers actually take delivery 			 			without a checkbook or credit card.			 			 While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership.			 						 			 Do you take trade-ins?			 						 			Yes.			 			 We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either.  We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases.			 						 			What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth.			 						 			This is another very common situation that usually 			 			 won't 			 			prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle.			 						 			 Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate?			 						 			We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help.			 						 			We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.			 						 			So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do?			 						 			COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page.  Just ask ""Where might I see this vehicle?"". Someone will respond promptly.			 						 			 I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there?			 						 			Yes. We have very simple process for this very common situation. Just give us a call.			 						About UsWe make buying and selling a pre-owned vehicle easy. Our 1Price-Pre-Owned Vehicles come with a 5-day return policy, Sirius XM  and more. Shop certified pre-owned vehicles online or in-store. Plus, wellbuy your car, no purchase necessary.

The truck has the TRD Tow Package, 2” lift and comes with a Tonneau bed cover.    I have all maintenance records but am  selling as the engine suddenly went out and do not plan to replace as we need a larger truck to fit our family.   The mechanic says the engine has lost compression in 1st cylinder and misfires on other cylinders.   It has been a great pickup and had no previous issues.  I have babied this truck and am sure has lots of miles left in it once the engine is replaced or repared.

If youre seeing this ad, it is likely that the vehicle IS for sale within the Autonation network. Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved.  Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time.			 						 			 This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don't still have this vehicle, do you?			 						 			If the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you.			 						 			You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot?			 						 			No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.			 						 			Can I really secure financing with zero down payment?			 						 			Many customers actually take delivery 			 			without a checkbook or credit card.			 			 While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership.			 						 			 Do you take trade-ins?			 						 			Yes.			 			 We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either.  We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases.			 						 			What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth.			 						 			This is another very common situation that usually 			 			 won't 			 			prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle.			 						 			 Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate?			 						 			We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help.			 						 			We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.			 						 			So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do?			 						 			COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page.  Just ask ""Where might I see this vehicle?"". Someone will respond promptly.			 						 			 I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there?			 						 			Yes. We have very simple process for this very common situation. Just give us a call.			 						Accessories & color may vary. Dealer not responsible for errors or omissions.
